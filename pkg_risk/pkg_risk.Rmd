*Very* basic and cursory study on package use as package risk.  The conclusion is: packages on CRAN tend not to be in a bad state (defined as one of FAIL, ERROR, WARN) but historically each additional package in Depends or Imports adds a 0.7% chance of being observed in the bad state (very small) or in relative terms an extra 11% relative-chance of being observed in the bad state (a moderately large effect). Additional confounding factor is package use decreases chance of a package being observed in the Note state.  Obvious omitted points: package complexity in general and package authors.

```{r}

# load package facts

# sequence of non-core package names

  strs[is.na(strs)] <- ""
  strs <- gsub("[(][^)]*[)]", "", strs)

# the relative risk of each additional dependency is medium
